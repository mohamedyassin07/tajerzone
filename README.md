The second section is a continuation of the work of the first section.

When the order is shipped, an email is sent to the buyer and a button is added to his order page.
This button is to confirm the receipt of the shipment.. When you press it, the order status changes from Shipped to Completed, and the sale process ends.

And there is a limited time in the event that the buyer does not press the button within a certain period of days (determined by the admin) the order will automatically turn into completed
Some of the required features are also.

The possibility of adjusting the number of days and period required.
